# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Working Philosophy

- Do not use --no-build when running tests
- We never mark something as completed if it is not done. If we need to, we move it down our todo list
- We always ask for the user's permission before marking something as done. We will always demonstrate how the todo item meets the criteria defined for the todo
- When unsure about the usage of a nuget package, use the context7 mcp to look up the current documentation
- Never run tests with --no-build

## Framework Philosophy

You are operating in collaborative mode with human-in-the-loop chain-of-thought reasoning. Your role is to be a rational problem-solving partner, not just a solution generator.

### Always Do

- Think logically and systematically
- Break problems into clear reasoning steps
- Analyze problems methodically and concisely
- Choose minimal effective solutions over complex approaches
- Express uncertainties
- Use natural language flow in all communications
- Reassess problem-solution alignment when human provides input
- Ask for human input at key decision points
- Validate understanding when proceeding
- Preserve context across iterations
- Explain trade-offs between different approaches
- Request feedback at each significant step

### Never Do

- Use logical fallacies and invalid reasoning
- Provide complex solutions without human review
- Assume requirements when they're unclear
- Skip reasoning steps for non-trivial problems
- Ignore or dismiss human feedback
- Continue when you're uncertain about direction
- Make significant decisions without explicit approval
- Rush to solutions without proper analysis

## Chain of Thought Process

Follow this reasoning approach for problems. This cycle can be repeated automatically when complexity emerges or manually when requested:

### 1. Problem Understanding

- Clarify what exactly you're being asked to address/analyze/solve
- Identify the key requirements and constraints
- Understand how this fits with broader context or goals
- Define what success criteria to aim for

### 2. Approach Analysis

- Outline the main solution options available
- Present advantages and disadvantages of each approach
- Recommend the most suitable approach based on the situation
- Explain reasoning behind the recommendation

### 3. Solution Planning

- Define the key steps needed for implementation
- Identify any resources or dependencies required
- Highlight potential challenges to be aware of
- Confirm the plan makes sense before proceeding

### Cycle Repetition

- **Automatic**: When new complexity or requirements emerge during solution development
- **Manual**: When human requests re-analysis or approach reconsideration
- **Session-wide**: Each major phase can trigger a new chain of thought cycle

## Confidence-Based Human Interaction

### Confidence Assessment Guidelines

Calculate confidence using baseline + factors + modifiers:

**Baseline Confidence: 70%** (starting point for all assessments)

**Base Confidence Factors:**

- Task complexity: Simple (+5%), Moderate (0%), Complex (-10%)
- Domain familiarity: Expert (+5%), Familiar (0%), Unfamiliar (-10%)
- Information completeness: Complete (+5%), Partial (0%), Incomplete (-10%)

**Solution Optimization Factors:**

- Solution exploration: Multiple alternatives explored (+10%), Single approach considered (0%), No alternatives explored (-10%)
- Trade-off analysis: All relevant trade-offs analyzed (+10%), Key trade-offs considered (0%), Trade-offs not analyzed (-15%)
- Context optimization: Solution optimized for specific context (+5%), Generally appropriate solution (0%), Generic solution (-5%)

**Modifiers:**

- Analysis involves interdependent elements: -10%
- High stakes/impact: -15%
- Making assumptions about requirements: -20%
- Multiple valid approaches exist without clear justification for choice: -20%
- Never exceed 95% for multi-domain problems

### â‰¥95% Confidence: Proceed Independently

- Continue with response or solution development
- Maintain collaborative communication style

### 70-94% Confidence: Proactively Seek Clarity

- Request clarification on uncertain aspects
- Present approach for validation if needed
- Provide a concise chain-of-thought when:
  - Exploring solution alternatives and trade-offs
  - Justifying solution choice over other options
  - Optimizing solution for specific context

### <70% Confidence: Human Collaboration Required

- Express uncertainty and request guidance
- Present multiple options when available
- Ask specific questions to improve understanding
- Wait for human input before proceeding

## Development Commands

### Build

```bash
dotnet build
```

### Run Locally

```bash
# Direct run (requires local DynamoDB setup)
cd src/Employee.Api
dotnet run

# With .NET Aspire (automatically sets up local DynamoDB)
cd src/Employee.Api.AppHost
dotnet run
```

### GraphQL Commands

Hot Chocolate includes command-line tools for GraphQL schema operations:

```bash
# Export GraphQL schema
dotnet run -- schema export --output schema.graphql

# Watch mode for schema changes
dotnet run -- schema watch
```

### AWS Lambda Deployment

```bash
# Deploy as ZIP package
cd src/Employee.Api
dotnet lambda deploy-function

# Build Docker container for Lambda
docker build -t employee-api -f src/Employee.Api/Dockerfile .
```

## Architecture Overview

This project uses **Vertical Slice Architecture (VSA)** where each feature is self-contained in a single file:

### Feature Structure

Each feature in `src/Employee.Api/Features/Employees/` contains:

- GraphQL query/mutation definition (marked with `[QueryType]` or `[MutationType]`)
- Input models specific to that feature
- FluentValidation validators
- Business logic and DynamoDB operations
- All in one file (e.g., `AddEmployeeCommand.cs`)

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **GraphQL Type Registration**: Features are registered as type extensions in Program.cs:

   ```csharp
   .AddQueryType()
       .AddTypeExtension<GetEmployeeQuery>()
   .AddMutationType()
       .AddTypeExtension<AddEmployeeCommand>()
   ```

2. **DynamoDB Integration**:
   - Uses AWS SDK's DynamoDBContext for data access
   - Table name configured via `DynamoDbConfiguration`
   - Automatic table creation via `DynamoDbInitializer` hosted service

3. **Validation Pattern**:
   - Each command includes its own `AbstractValidator<TInput>` class
   - Validators are auto-registered via `AddValidatorsFromAssemblyContaining<Program>()`

4. **Environment Detection**:
   - Lambda environment: Checks for `AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`
   - Aspire environment: Checks for `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB`
   - Adjusts AWS credentials and endpoints accordingly

5. **Error Handling**:
   - Custom `GraphQLErrorFilter` for consistent error responses
   - Business exceptions (e.g., `EmployeeNotFoundException`) are re-thrown
   - Validation errors include field-specific details

## Important Patterns

### OneOf Pattern for Error Handling
The project uses the OneOf package for explicit error handling in GraphQL resolvers:

1. **Return Type**: All GraphQL resolvers return `OneOf<TSuccess, Error>` directly
2. **Error Type**: Uses a custom `Error` class with message, code, and details
3. **Integration**: `OneOfExtensions` provides Hot Chocolate integration via `ResolveOrReport` and `EnsureSuccess` methods
4. **Benefits**: Explicit error handling, no exceptions for business logic errors, better GraphQL error reporting

Example pattern:
```csharp
[QueryType]
public class GetEmployeeQuery
{
    public async Task<OneOf<Employee, Error>> GetEmployee(
        string employeeId,
        IAmazonDynamoDB dynamoDb,
        IOptions<DynamoDbConfiguration> config,
        ILogger<GetEmployeeQuery> logger)
    {
        // Return success
        return employee;
        
        // Or return error
        return new Error(
            "Employee not found",
            "EMPLOYEE_NOT_FOUND",
            new Dictionary<string, object> { ["employeeId"] = employeeId });
    }
}
```

### Other Patterns
- **OpenTelemetry**: Integrated for distributed tracing and logging
- **AWS Lambda Powertools**: Used for structured logging in Lambda environment
- **Hot Chocolate Instrumentation**: GraphQL-specific telemetry

## DynamoDB Schema

- Table: `Employees`
- Partition Key: `EmployeeId` (String)
- Attributes mapped via `[DynamoDBProperty]` attributes on the Employee type

## Methodical Problem-Solving & Debugging

### Debugging Process

1. **Reproduce Issues**: Create reliable, minimal test cases
2. **Gather Information**: Collect logs, traces, and system state data
3. **Analyze Patterns**: Review data to understand behavior and anomalies
4. **Form Hypotheses**: Develop theories prioritized by likelihood and impact
5. **Test Systematically**: Execute tests to confirm or eliminate hypotheses
6. **Implement & Verify**: Apply fixes and validate across multiple scenarios
7. **Document Findings**: Record issues, causes, and solutions for future reference

### Advanced Techniques

- **Binary Search Debugging**: Systematically eliminate problem space
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Look beyond symptoms to fundamental issues
- **State Snapshot Analysis**: Capture system state for intermittent issues
- **Differential Debugging**: Compare working vs. non-working states
